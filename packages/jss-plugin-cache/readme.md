# JSS plugin that caches the rules.

This plugin will cache virtual rules by checking if a past style object has been already passed.

It should be used as a **first** plugin, to bail out before any unnecessary work is done!!!

Make sure you read [how to use
plugins](https://github.com/cssinjs/jss/blob/master/docs/setup.md#setup-with-plugins)
in general.

## Caveats

1.  Don't use it if you mutate your `styles`.

1.  Don't use it if you generate an huge amount of different rules. For e.g. if you generate for every request or for every user different styles. The cache memory footprint will grow proportionally to the amount of unique styles.

1.  If your `styles` objects are not static, they won't be cached. It adds a flag to the object in order to identify it and reuses the virtual rule for it then.
