# Contributing

## Prerequisites

To install the development dependencies, you will at least need Node 8 installed.

## Installation

We use Yarn as our package manager.
It will install all dev dependencies and the dependencies in the actual packages.

```bash
yarn
```

## Building

For building all of the packages run:

```bash
yarn build
```

## Lint & Formatting & Typechecking

To lint, format, and type check the project run the following commands:

```bash
yarn check:lint
yarn format
yarn check:ts
```

## Run tests

Using karma (real browsers will get launched).

> Notice: When you change the source files of packages, you will need to rebuild the project.

```bash
yarn test
```

## IDEs

If you are using VS Code, you'll need to do 2 things to get Flow type support:

1. Install the [Flow Language Support extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=flowtype.flow-for-vscode).
2. If necessary, update your _local_ settings to disable JS file validation:

```JSON
// <PROJECT_ROOT>/.vscode/settings.json
{
  "javascript.validate.enable": false
}
```
